1. Goal
The goal for this assignment is to set up FreeBSD environment properly. Additionally, write a simple program that does the same thing as the Unix tail command. The program needs to read a set of files and copy data from the last 10 lines of each of the files specified in the command line to standard output.

2. Assumptions
I'm assuming that newlines are represented by the character \n. The last 10 newlines would be outputted essentially. If the last line of the file doesn't have a newline, I would still count it as a line and I'll keep in mind of this for the goal of this program.

3. Design
For this program, I would need to count the bytes of the file since I am only allowed to use system calls. To count the number of lines, I would increment count whenever my character array has a newline. With the total count number, I would find how many lines there are before the last 10 lines. I would close the file, and read it again to set up a new character array. Whenever count2, the count for the new array, reaches the number of lines there are before the last 10 lines, I will save that byte number which starts the tail. Then I will use write(), and write the output starting at that specific byte I found until the file ends.

4. Pseudocode
int main()
    while(there are files to be read) {
	open file
	char buffer
	char new line

	if(file < 0)
		error

	while(read(file bytes))
		buffer[file bytes]
		if buffer[] == \n
			count ++
		for
			x =find the number of lines before last 10 lines
	close(file)

	open(file)
	while(read(bytes of 2nd char array))
		if(count2 = x)
			specific byte = byte of x

	write(specfic byte starts till end of file)

	if(file has less than 10 lines)
		write(whole file)

	close(file)
	}
